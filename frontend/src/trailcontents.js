    content: `We set out from Nila campus on a pleasant Sunday morning.
    The bus packed with a group of bubbling students bursting
    with energy was headed to Dhoni, half an hour away from the
    campus. Earth's lush green carpet sprang to life as we
    approached Dhoni.We began the 4 km long trek to the
    waterfalls by half past ten. Noisy brooks rushing downhill
    shimmered as they dashed against the rocks The trail was
    clear with the occasional steep shortcut for the thrill
    seekers. The thick canopy shielded us from the sun as we
    made our way up. Colourful butterflies frolicked on the
    flowers and bushes. We were fascinated by a railway sleeper
    tree along the way. After an hour of trekking the steady
    burble of running water transformed into a roar. Within a
    few minutes we reached the most exciting part of the trek,
    the falls. The chilly water couldn't stop us! Stepping into
    the knee deep rocky bed gave us euphoric chills. Soon we
    were immersed in playing around in the water. Be it
    splashing water on others, lying under the fall, spotting
    tiny fish, building pebble towers, sitting on boulders while
    water rushed down our legs, we enjoyed our time thoroughly.
    Sadly, soon it was time to leave. We bid a half hearted
    goodbye to the water with a promise to return to again be
    lulled into the capturing trance of Dhoni.`,
